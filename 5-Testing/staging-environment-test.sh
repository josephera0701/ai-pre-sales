## System Integration Status

### Core Functionality Ready
1. **User Authentication** - JWT token-based auth system
2. **Cost Calculation** - AWS pricing engine with recommendations
3. **Excel Processing** - Template validation and data mapping
4. **Document Generation** - PDF, Word, and Excel export
5. **User Management** - Profile and role management
6. **Frontend Interface** - React SPA with all features

### API Integration
- **Authentication Flow:** All services use JWT validation
- **Data Flow:** RESTful APIs with JSON communication
- **Error Handling:** Standardized error responses
- **Security:** Role-based access control implemented

## Test Scenarios Available

### 1. User Registration & Authentication
\`\`\`
Test Flow:
1. Access frontend application
2. Register new user account
3. Verify email (if configured)
4. Login with credentials
5. Access protected dashboard
\`\`\`

### 2. Cost Estimation Workflow
\`\`\`
Test Flow:
1. Login to application
2. Navigate to cost estimation form
3. Enter project requirements
4. Calculate AWS infrastructure costs
5. Review cost breakdown and recommendations
\`\`\`

### 3. Excel Template Processing
\`\`\`
Test Flow:
1. Upload Excel template file
2. Validate template structure
3. Process data mapping
4. Generate cost estimation from Excel data
5. Export results to new Excel file
\`\`\`

### 4. Document Generation
\`\`\`
Test Flow:
1. Complete cost estimation
2. Select document format (PDF/Word/Excel)
3. Generate professional proposal document
4. Download generated document
5. Verify content accuracy and formatting
\`\`\`

## Performance Expectations
- **Frontend Load Time:** < 3 seconds
- **API Response Time:** < 500ms
- **Document Generation:** < 30 seconds
- **Excel Processing:** < 60 seconds
- **Authentication:** < 200ms

## Security Features Active
- **HTTPS Enforcement:** All communications encrypted
- **JWT Authentication:** Secure token-based auth
- **Role-Based Access:** User/admin role separation
- **Input Validation:** All user inputs sanitized
- **CORS Configuration:** Proper cross-origin policies

## Staging Environment Status
$([ $FAILED_COUNT -eq 0 ] && echo "✅ **FULLY OPERATIONAL**

All 6 components are deployed and ready for comprehensive user testing. The staging environment provides a complete replica of the production system." || echo "❌ **PARTIAL DEPLOYMENT**

$FAILED_COUNT component(s) need to be deployed before full system testing can begin.")

## Next Steps for Testing
1. **Smoke Tests:** Verify all components respond
2. **Integration Tests:** Test component interactions
3. **User Acceptance Tests:** End-to-end user workflows
4. **Performance Tests:** Load and stress testing
5. **Security Tests:** Authentication and authorization

## Access Information
- **Frontend URL:** Ready for CloudFront deployment
- **API Gateway:** Configured for all backend services
- **Database:** DynamoDB tables created and configured
- **Storage:** S3 buckets for files and documents
